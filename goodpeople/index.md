At Blackbuck Computing, we are building a more joyful mobile internet. 

Our first product, Fastahâ„¢, is a smartphone data manager that helps people manage their mobile data in a more personalized way, saving them money and given them control over their apps and activities. 

[Our team](http://fastah.blackbuck.mobi/about/) has a strong DNA in engineering and consumer understanding.

## How we work
* Consumer interviews: We talk to potential users of our software about their pain points. We test our assumptions with them.
* Product thinking: We hope to build software products that are both grounded in consumer needs as well as based on a vision of a better internet.
* Software engineering: Our software and infrastructure is designed and built to give our users a high quality-of-service.
* Operating quality: We take privacy and trust very seriously. We aim to please with our customer service.
