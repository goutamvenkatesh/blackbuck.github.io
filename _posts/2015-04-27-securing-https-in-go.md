The [Go programming language](http://golang.org) makes it easy to write and deploy servers offering HTTPS ( HTTP + Transport Layer Security) to clients. The crypto package in Go's standard library is easy to use and well documented: it's an under-explored gem. Due to it's low-on-legacy implementation of modern standards and easy configurability, there is no reason to insert an Apache or Nginx server to terminate TLS connections. A Go application server can do it all including being the front-end. All without OpenSSL!

Within the Go standard library, the http package provides the ```ListenAndServeTLS()``` API that offers secure HTTP to clients. Once a server is functionally working, how does one check HTTPS configuration and security? Here is a practical guide: 

1. Pick an audit tool to test your HTTP+TLS server
3. Understand any failures
4. Fix the issues
5. (Rinse and Repeat)

## PICK an audit tool
Let's start with the right tool. In this article, we use [scanner at Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). It's recommended by [Adam Langley](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html), security maven and key author of Go's "crypto" codebase.

## RUN the tool
  * Be prepared for failing grades, like the "C" below
  * Pay attention to the security warnings shown in color-coded message boxes. Work to fix them next.

## FIX the security issues
The first significant misconfiguration reported by the above scan is the possibility of a POODLE attack. While Go doesn't support the older SSLv3 at all, you can still make the server do a smarter TLS handshake by explicitly configuring it to only advertise support of vTLS 1.0 or higher. This is done by setting ```tls.Config.MinVersion```:
{% raw %}
	// Make a server negotiate only TLS v1.0+ with clients
	config := &tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS10}
	s := &http.Server{TLSConfig: config}
	s.ListenAndServeTLS()
{% endraw %}

Next, is the yellow-coded warning about use of a weak cipher: RC4. You may fix this error by limited ciphers to a stronger set via ```tls.Config.CipherSuites```. Also notice the use of ```PreferServerCipherSuites``` member to force TLS negotiation to pick a result from the (presumably) stronger list of server-specified ciphers. 
{% raw %}
	// Work for iOS 6+ Safari, WP 8.x IE 11 and Android 4.4.2+
	config := &tls.Config{
		MinVersion:               tls.VersionTLS12,
		PreferServerCipherSuites: true,
		CipherSuites: []uint16{tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
			tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
			tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,
			tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
			tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,
			tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
			....
		},
	}
{% endraw %}

For a comprehensive understanding of the warnings flagged by the tool, check out [Mozilla's guide to TLS and cipher suites](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS). 


## Rejoice at your passing grade!
Once you have fixed the issues flagged by the tool, an all-green report card awaits.

A word of caution: Before changing Go's defaults, please do read the [standard library documentation TLS](http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/), and [Mozilla's guide to TLS and cipher suites](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS). Additional factors to consider while tuning the HTTPS server are:

 * network round-trips required to negotiate a TLS connection
 * encryption quality and CPU cost trade-off
 * legal implications if applicable. 

Happy security!
